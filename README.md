## Course description

The course aims at providing general knowledge about distributed programming, methodologies and tools. The course starts by reviewing the basic concepts relevant to the course, then presents how distributed systems are organized and basic communication mechanisms. The course then presents the basic techniques for developing modern distributed systems using the web, IoT, and mobile technologies.

## Learning objectives

After completing this course students will be able to understand and describe the architectural organization of a generic distributed system; to use high level communication mechanisms as e.g. Remote Procedure Call, RESTful APIs and message-oriented middleware; to develop modern web, mobile and IoT applications.
